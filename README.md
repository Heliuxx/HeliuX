# I am HeliuX ðŸ‘‹

## I have worked in the Physical, Biological, and Data Analyst fields.  I dont really talk about my biological experience too much here on Github, but for data analysis I have experience with larger structured databases, data representation through visualization, data decluttering/validation, and complex model simplification.

I have direct experience with different lines of data collection/Analyis including Physical representations of theoretical and actual phenomenon, as well as Laboratory information management systems (LIMS) admin/analysis. I dont have a complete list of EVERYTHING I have done, but I do some some things here to hopefully give you a decent idea.


--please see my work for my examples! ðŸ˜ƒ
