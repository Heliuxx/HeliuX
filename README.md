# I am HeliuX ðŸ‘‹

## I have worked in the Physical, Biological, and Data Science fields.  I am currently striving to further my career by utilizing my experience and developed skills in Data Analytics.

Being in those fields I have aquired and developed proficient skills in larger structured databases, data representation through visualization, data decluttering/validation, and complex model simplification. I have direct experience with different lines of data collection/Analyis including Physical representations of theoretical and actual phenomenon, as well as Laboratory information management systems (LIMS) admin/analysis. I dont have a complete list of EVERYTHING I have done, but I do some some things here to hopefully give you a decent idea.


--please see my work for my examples! ðŸ˜ƒ
